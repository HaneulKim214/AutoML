[Keras-Tuner]
 - class Oracle : implements hyperparameter optimization algorithm
 - class Tuner : manages building, training, evaluation and saving of the keras models.
 - class BaseTuner : base class for all Tuners, manages search loop, Oracle, logging, saving, etc...
   - _populate_initial_space() : Populates initial search space for oracle
     - This is where initial build of our custom HyperModel happens.
       - hyperparameter gets chosen here.
     - at the end of BaseTuner init function.


tuner.search()
  - results = self.run_trial()
    - called multiple times during 'search' to build and evaluate
      the models with diff hyp and returns objective value.
    - _build_and_fit_model() : build then fit model.
    - self.oracle.update_trial() : report status/result of current trial.



Tips:
 - Keras tuner don't run when you want to save your search results to already existing directory.
